# Lab Exercise 4: 
```
This lab is an introduction to debouncing and PWMs. The goal is to be able to control the debounce generated by a switch, implement software PWM and hardware PWM.

```

#  Usage

```
Debounce
      Switches/button are not ideal and have a bouncing effect when flipped/pushed. The purpouse of debounce is to control said bounce          to prevent multiple triggering events from a single flip/push.

Hardware PWM
      In hardware PWM the registers get updated when the duty cycle needs to change

Software PWM
      Software PWM can use any output form and it uses a time to count to a certain value before resetting. This is what controls the         duty cycle.
      
```

## Valid Inputs

```
Debounce
    button press / swtich.
        -false trigger solved in software-
        
Hardware PWM
    -N/A-
    
Software PWM
    -N/A-
```

# Functions

```
Debounce
      -N/A-
Hardware PWM
